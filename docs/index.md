# RABV REDCap Project 
This project supports diagnostic and sequencing-related metadata for rabies virus (RABV) samples across research projects in:

- **East Africa** (Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda)  
- **Philippines**
- **Peru**

**To be supported in future:**

- Nigeria  
- Malawi

# Data dictionary 

The intention of this REDCap project is to centralise data collected across all project areas. A single data dictionary has been developed to ensure consistency for shared variables, while also allowing for the inclusion of country-specific fields to capture relevant local information. As a result, some fields may not be applicable to all users.

The dictionary is organised into two forms:
- **Diagnostic**: capturing metadata related to sample collection and testing.
- **Sequencing**: capturing details on sequencing, platforms used, and analysis summaries.

Fields are based on prior datasets and structured to ensure all necessary metadata can be tracked consistently. Some fields have been added or refined to improve data quality, compatibility with downstream analyses, and to enable smoother integration across sites.
